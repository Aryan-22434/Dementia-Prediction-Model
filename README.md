# 🧠 Dementia Prediction Model Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to develop dementia, based on clinical and imaging features from the OASIS dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [OASIS Brains Dataset](https://www.oasis-brains.org/)
- Features include: Age, Gender, Education, MMSE score, SES, Brain volume, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Preprocess categorical and numerical features
3. Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
4. Evaluate with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

## ✅ Model Accuracy
- Achieved ~87% accuracy with Random Forest

## 🧪 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python dementia_prediction.py
```
